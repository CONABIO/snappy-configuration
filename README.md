# snappy-configuration
 This repository contains instructions and commands to configure snappy in a fresh linux environment.

# Downloads
First, it is necessary to download the files that we are going to use in the virtual environment and snappy package configuration. 
We will use [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) to manage the virtual environment and install the necessary dependencies there and we can get snappy from [ESA](https://step.esa.int/main/download/snap-download/) download page .

``` bash
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2019.10-MacOSX-x86_64.pkg
wget http://step.esa.int/downloads/7.0/installers/esa-snap_sentinel_unix_7_0.sh
```
